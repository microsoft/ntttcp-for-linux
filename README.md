# NTTTCP-for-Linux

## Summary

A multiple-threaded Linux network throughput benchmark tool.

## Features

* Multiple threads to send/receive data ('-P', '-n', and '-l'). By default, Receiver ('-r') uses 16 threads and Sender ('-s') uses 64 threads to exchange data.

* Support cpu affinity ('-m').

* Support running in background (daemon, '-D').

* Support Sender and Receiver sync mode by default. Use "-N" (no_sync) to disable the sync.

* Support testing with multiple clients mode (use '-M' on Receiver, and '-L' on the last Sender).

* Support select() by default, and epoll() (use '-e' on Receiver).

* Support both TCP (by default), and UDP ('-u') tests.

* Support pin TCP server or client port (use '-p' on Receiver or '-f' on Sender).

* Support test Warmup ('-W') and Cooldown ('-C').

* Support reporting TCP retransmit ('--show-tcp-retrans').

* Support reporting number of packets ('--show-nic-packets') and number of interrupts ('--show-dev-interrupts').

* Support bandwidth limit ('-B' or '--fq-rate-limit').

* Support capturing console log to file ('-O').

* Support writing log into XML file ('-x').

* Support writing log into JSON file ('-j').


## Getting Started
sudo pkg install libepoll-shim (this gives epoll implementation using kqueue)

### Building NTTTCP-for-FreeBSD ###

- Using `make`:
```
	make; make install
```



### Usage
	
	ntttcp -h

### Known issues

 

### Example run

To measure the network performance between two multi-core serves running SLES 12, NODE1 (192.168.4.1) and NODE2 (192.168.4.2), connected via a 40 GigE connection. 

On NODE1 (the receiver), run:
```
./ntttcp -r
```
(Translation: Run ntttcp as a receiver with default setting. The default setting includes: with 16 threads created and run across all CPUs, allocating 64K receiver buffer, and run for 60 seconds.)

And on NODE2 (the sender), run:
```
./ntttcp -s192.168.4.1
```
(Translation: Run ntttcp as a sender, with default setting. The default setting includes: with 64 threads created and run across all CPUs, allocating 128KB sender buffer, and run for 60 seconds.)

Using the above parameters, the program returns results on both the sender and receiver nodes, correlating network communication to CPU utilization.  

Example receiver-side output from a given run (which showcases 37.66 Gbps throughput):

```
NODE1:/home/simonxiaoss/ntttcp-for-linux/src # ./ntttcp -s 10.0.0.1 -W 1 -t 10 -C 1
